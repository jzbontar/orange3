Detailed Walkthrough for OSX
----------------------------
You will need the latest version od XCode you can download from the AppStore. When it is installed, go to the Preferences/Downloads and download Command Line Tools.
The easiest way to setup all the requirements for your virtual environment is using homebrew. You can install it using the following command:

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

Follow any instructions it gives you to complete the installation. In order to compile the necessary python packages, you will need at least python3.2, gfortran and sparse. Some of them are not located in the main repository, so you need to tap them first:

brew tap homebrew/versions
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install python32 gfortran suite-sparse

Create virtual env for orange3.

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3.2 o3
source o3/bin/activate

git clone https://github.com/biolab/orange3.git
cd orange3
pip install numpy mercurial
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop

And you are done.

If you also want to use the GUI, you should continue with downloading sip and pyqt from http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro 
To install them, run python configure.py followed by make -j 4 (if you have 4 cores) and make install.
